# Survey_Report
In this small project, a Power BI dashboard was created using real data collected from a survey conducted among individuals regarding their employment status and related information. The collected data was processed and cleaned using Power Query to ensure accuracy and reliability. Subsequently, a Power BI dashboard was developed, providing valuable insights derived from the survey data. This project enabled us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the participants' employment situations and other relevant factors, facilitating informed analysis and decision-making.
